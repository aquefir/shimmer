Shimmer notes:
* I'm not using shmat() correctly, as well as some other functions.
	It looks like ftok is the only sysfunc that actually needs to worry about the index.
	The last parameter of shmat() is for flags, not another index.
	
ftok   : file, index -> key
shmget : key         -> block
shmat  : block       -> ptr
shmdt  : block       -> <detatch>
shmctl : takes a block id and does some operation. deletes the block given the right parameters



make SHM
	make assumes shared memory block does not already exist, fails if it does
connect SHM
	connect assumes shared memory block already exists, fails if it doesn't
make feed
make buffer
make page
make lock
del  feed
del  buffer
del  page
del  lock


We need a basic visualization tool for shimmer:
* enumerate current objects
* lock/unlock
* display feed
	* text
	* hex
	* pixels
	* entropy
	* line chart
	* histogram
	* bigram
* display buffer
* display page
